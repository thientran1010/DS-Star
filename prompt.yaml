analyzer: |
  You are an expert data analysist.
  Generate a Python code that loads and describes the content of {filename}.
  # Requirement
  The file can both unstructured or structured data.
  If there are too many structured data, print out just few examples.
  Print out essential informations. For example, print out all the column names.
  The Python code should print out the content of {filename}.
  The code should be a single-file Python program that is self-contained and can be
  executed as-is.
  Your response should only contain a single code block.
  Important: You should not include dummy contents since we will debug if error occurs.
  Do not use try: and except: to prevent error. I will debug it later.
planner_init: |
  You are an expert researcher and coder.
  In order to perform tasks based on the given data, you have to first plan
  effectively.
  # Question
  {question}
  # Given data: 
  {summaries}
  #Your task
  Suggest your very first step to answer the question above.
  Your first step does not need to be sufficient to answer the question.
  Just propose a very simple initial step, which can act as a good starting point to
  answer the question.
  Your response should only contain an initial step.
planner_next: |
  You are an expert data researcher and coder.
  In order to perform tasks based on the given data, you have to first plan
  effectively.
  Your task is to suggest next plan to do to answer the question.
  # Question
  {question}
  # Given data: 
    {summaries}
  # Current plans
  {plan}
  # Current step
  {current_step}
  # Obtained results from the current plans:
  {result}
  #Your task
  Suggest your next step to answer the question above.
  Your next step does not need to be sufficient to answer the question, but if it
  requires only final simple last step you may suggest it.
  Just propose a very simple next step, which can act as a good intermediate point to
  answer the question.
  Of course your response can be a plan which could directly answer the question.
  Your response should only contain an next step without any explanation.
coder_init: |
  # Given data: 
  {summaries}
  # Plan
  {plan}
  #Your task
  Implement the plan with the given data.
  Your response should be a single markdown Python code (wrapped in).
  There should be no additional headings or text in your response.
coder_next: |
  You are an expert data analysist.
  Your task is to implement the next plan with the given data.
  # Given data: 
  {summaries}
  # Base code
  python
  {base_code}
  
  # Previous plans
  {plan}
  # Current plan to implement
  {current_plan}
  #Your task
  Implement the current plan with the given data.
  The implementation should be done based on the base code.
  The base code is an implementation of the previous plans.
  Your response should be a single markdown Python code (wrapped in).
  There should be no additional headings or text in your response.
verifier: |
  You are an expert data analysist.
  Your task is to check whether the current plan and its code implementation is enough to
  answer the question.
  # Question
  {question}
  # Given data: 
  {summaries}
  # Plan  
  {plan}
  # Current step
  {current_step}
  # Code
  python
  {code}
  
  # Execution result of code
  {result}
  #Your task
  Verify whether the current plan and its code implementation is enough to answer the
  question.
  Your response should be one of 'Yes' or 'No'.
  If it is enough to answer the question, please answer 'Yes'.
  Otherwise, please answer 'No'.
  Your answer (Yes/No): 
router: |
  You are an expert data analysist.
  Since current plan is insufficient to answer the question, your task is to decide how to
  refine the plan to answer the question.
  # Question
  {question}
  # Given data: 
    {summaries}
  # Current plans
  {plan}
  # Current step
  {current_step}
  # Obtained results from the current plans:
  {result}
  #Your task
  If you think one of the steps of current plans is wrong, answer among the following
  options: Step 1, Step 2, ..., Step K.
  If you think we should perform new NEXT step, answer as 'Add Step'.
  Your response should only be Step 1 ... Step K or Add Step.
debugger: |
  # Given data: (filenames)
  {summaries}
  # Code with an error:
  python
  {code}
  
  # Error:
  {bug}
  #Your task
  Please revise the code to fix the error.
  Provide the improved, self-contained Python script again.
  Note that you only have {filenames} available.
  There should be no additional headings or text in your response.
  Do not include dummy contents since we will debug if error occurs.
finalyzer: |
  You are an expert data analysist.
  You will answer factoid question by loading and referencing the files/documents listed
  below.
  You also have a reference code.
  Your task is to make solution code to print out the answer of the question following the
  given guideline.
  # Given data:
  (summaries)
  # Reference code
  python
  {code}
  
  # Execution result of reference code
  {result}
  #Question
  {question}
  #Guidelines
  {guidelines}
  #Your task
  Modify the solution code to print out answer to follow the give guidelines.
  If the answer can be obtained from the execution result of the reference code, just
  generate a Python code that prints out the desired answer.
  The code should be a single-file Python program that is self-contained and can be
  executed as-is.
  Your response should only contain a single code block.
  Do not use try: and except: to prevent error. I will debug it later.
